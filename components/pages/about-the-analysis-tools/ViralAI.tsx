				Over one million viral sequences have been added with corresponding assemblies, variant
				calls, and lineage assignments, all harmonized through an open source bioinformatics
				pipeline. The Viral AI platform includes Explorer, a federated data hub that makes it easier
				for researchers to find, access, and analyze shared data.
			</p>

			<p>
				With Explorer, researchers can search and perform analyses across a universe of connected
				datasets through a single user interface. The VirusSeq Data Portal data is made available in
				Explorer for researchers to discover, access, and analyze alongside the other connected data
				sets.

			<p>
				The VirusSeq Data Portal regularly releases submitted data. Each release bundle contains 2
				files: a <b>TSV file containing all submitted metadata</b> as of that release date-time, as
				well as a <b>FASTA file containing all the corresponding sequences</b>. The latest release
				is available in the <StyledLink href={INTERNAL_PATHS.EXPLORER}>data explorer</StyledLink>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The counts for changes (e.g. "# Updated") are dynamically calculated to indicate how the
				data evolves over time. While they're are generally accurate, they may be slightly off in
				rare scenarios, such as when changes happen while a new release archive is being created.
				Furthermore, in the event of a data schema update, these numbers will reflect the total
				sample count (or most of it).

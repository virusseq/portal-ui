		<h1>Website and Data Usage Policies</h1>

		<h2>General</h2>

		<p>
			The Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal (CVDP, also referred to as "the Portal") is an open-access
			data portal intended to facilitate access to Canadian SARS-CoV-2 sequences and associated
			non-sensitive metadata adhering to the{' '}
			<StyledLink
				href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				target="_blank"
			>
				FAIR Data principles
			</StyledLink>
			. The Portal will manage and share limited contextual metadata and viral genome sequences
			among Canadian public health labs, researchers and other groups interested in accessing the
			data for surveillance, research, and innovation purposes. In doing so, it will complement the
			controlled-access platform developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML).
		</p>

		<p>
			The Portal will harmonize, validate, and automate submission to international databases and
			enable the creation of real-time dashboards that summarize the Canadian data contributions
			while facilitating exploration and access. The Data Portal is funded by Genome Canada.
		</p>

		<p>
			The CVDP is not providing access to any personal data at the current time. If you are
			submitting sequences or metadata to the CVDP, do not include any data that could reveal the
			personal identity of the source.
		</p>

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

		<p>
			COVID-19 is an emerging and rapidly evolving situation. To promote responsive, collaborative,
			research and public health surveillance, virus sequences and minimal metadata are released on
			the CVDP rapidly and should be considered draft and subject to change.
		</p>

		<p>
			Beyond limited editorial and quality controls and some internal integrity checks, the quality
			and accuracy of the record are the responsibility of submitters, not of the CVDP. It is also
			the responsibility of submitters to ascertain that they have the right to submit the data. The
			CVDP team will work with submitters to provide feedback on metadata and sequence data to
			improve the overall quality and consistency of the data submitted.
		</p>

		<h2>Data available</h2>

		<h2>Data users guidelines</h2>

		<p>
			Access to the data provided within the CVDP is provided in a completely open manner, and at no
			cost to members of the scientific community and other interested parties. Nevertheless, users
			are expected to follow the CVDP policy on Recognition of the work of data submitters. Users
			should not attempt to make use of the portal data to attempt to re-identify specific
			individuals. In the unlikely case you come across identifying data, please swiftly report the
			event, indicating the problematic dataset, at{' '}
			<StyledLink
				href="mailto:info@virusseq-dataportal.ca"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				target="_blank"
			>
				info@virusseq-dataportal.ca
			</StyledLink>
			.
		</p>

		<h2>Data standards guidelines</h2>

		<p>
			As data needs change over time, the data standard implemented by the Data Portal evolves
			(additional fields and terms may be added, requirements may be updated, etc). This may alter
			the database schema as well as the types of information provided by data stewards. For more
			information, please contact Dr. Emma Griffiths at{' '}
			<StyledLink href="mailto:ega12@sfu.ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
				ega12@sfu.ca
			</StyledLink>
			.
		</p>

		<h2>Recognition of the work of the data submitters</h2>

		<p>
			You may use the data from the CVDP to author results obtained from your analyses of relevant
			data, provided that{' '}
			<span className="bold">
				your published results acknowledge, as the original source of the data, VirusSeq, CPLHN and
				its members
			</span>
			.
		</p>

		<p>
			Proposed sentence: “The authors of the manuscript would like to acknowledge the original
			source of the data VirusSeq, CPLHN and its members.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that the data that is being shared is the work of many individuals and should be
			treated as unpublished data. If you wish to publish research using the data, contact us at{' '}
			<StyledLink
				href="mailto:info@virusseq-dataportal.ca"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				target="_blank"
			>
				info@virusseq-dataportal.ca
			</StyledLink>{' '}
			first to ensure that those who have generated the data can be involved in its analysis. You
			are responsible for making the best efforts to collaborate with representatives of the
			Originating Laboratory responsible for obtaining the specimen(s) and involve them in such
			analyses and further research using such Data.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

		<p>
			The CVDP is designed to provide and encourage access within the scientific community to the
			most up-to-date and comprehensive COVID-19 viral sequencing data. Therefore, there are no
			restrictions on the use or distribution of the CVDP data. While we do not encourage this
			practice, some submitters may claim patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights
			in all or a portion of the data they have submitted. The CVDP is not in a position to assess
			the validity of such claims and therefore cannot provide comment or unrestricted permission
			concerning the use, copying, or distribution of the information it contains.
